# Provider Mapping System Implementation Tasks

## 1. Create JSON Structure
- [x] Define the JSON schema for provider mappings
- [x] Create initial `provider_mappings.json` file with default mappings
- [x] Include metadata like last update timestamp and version

## 2. Modify ProviderMapper Class
- [x] Update `__init__` to load mappings from JSON file
- [x] Add method to save mappings back to JSON
- [x] Implement atomic file operations to prevent corruption
- [x] Add error handling for JSON operations
- [x] Add version checking for JSON schema compatibility

## 3. Update Learning Mechanism
- [x] Modify `update_from_openai_result` to save new mappings to JSON
- [x] Add validation for new mappings before saving
- [x] Implement deduplication of similar patterns
- [x] Add confidence scoring for learned patterns

## 4. Add Backup System
- [x] Implement automatic backup of JSON file before updates
- [x] Add restore functionality from backup
- [x] Create backup rotation system

## 5. Add Testing
- [x] Create unit tests for JSON operations
- [x] Add tests for learning mechanism
- [x] Test file locking and concurrent access
- [x] Test backup and restore functionality

## 6. Documentation
- [x] Document JSON schema
- [x] Add examples of valid mappings
- [ ] Document backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## 7. Integration
- [ ] Update main script to handle JSON file not found
- [ ] Add logging for JSON operations
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation if JSON operations fail

## 8. Security
- [ ] Add file permission checks
- [ ] Implement file integrity verification
- [ ] Add validation for JSON content

## 9. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement caching of compiled patterns
- [ ] Add batch update capability
- [ ] Optimize JSON file size

## 10. Monitoring
- [ ] Add metrics for mapping hits/misses
- [ ] Track learning success rate
- [ ] Monitor JSON file size and growth

## Implementation Order
1. Start with basic JSON structure and loading
2. Implement save functionality
3. Add learning mechanism
4. Add backup system
5. Implement testing
6. Add documentation
7. Integrate with main script
8. Add security measures
9. Optimize performance
10. Add monitoring

## Success Criteria
- [ ] JSON file can be read and written reliably
- [ ] New mappings are learned and saved automatically
- [ ] System can recover from JSON file corruption
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] All operations are logged appropriately
- [ ] Tests cover all critical functionality
